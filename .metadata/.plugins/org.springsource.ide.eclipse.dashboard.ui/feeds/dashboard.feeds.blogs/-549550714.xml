    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of &lt;em&gt;This Week in Spring&lt;/em&gt;. This week I&amp;rsquo;m in sweet San Francisco, soaking up the sun and enjoying the fun of summer. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few meetings, and appearances, etc., but it is very nice to be home. By the by, I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking at the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/sfjava/"&gt;San Francisco Java User Group&lt;/a&gt; - come hang out and say hi! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, lots of good stuff (as usual), so let&amp;rsquo;s get to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/"&gt;Spring Cloud Data Flow&lt;/a&gt; team is pleased to announce the GA release of 2.2.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this GA release, Spring Cloud Data Flow team has worked on some of the key features including task application management, stability on the product by increasing the acceptance tests coverage across platforms (local, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry), bug fixes and enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task Application Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible to stop and delete task executions using the SCDF Dashboard and the Shell.&lt;br/&gt;We have added support for task application monitoring using micrometer integration. The core of the Micrometer integration landed in Spring Cloud Task&amp;rsquo;s 2.2.0 release-line, which by the way is a requirement if you are going to try out the Task-metrics and the SCDF integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ecNfohOuzMI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For convenience, we have a &lt;a href="https://github.com/tzolov/task-demo-metrics/blob/master/README.md"&gt;sample application&lt;/a&gt; that builds on the compatible upstream versions of Spring Boot, Spring Batch, and Spring Cloud Task. With this application launched in SCDF, you are now able to instrument metrics with InfluxDB as the backend, and likewise visualize the statistics through Grafana dashboard as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzolov/task-demo-metrics/master/docs/grafana-task.png" alt="Screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessing the stream/task application logs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud Data Flow dashboard shows the stream and task applications logs. This feature is available in local, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry platforms. Spring Cloud Data Flow&amp;rsquo;s dashboard now exposes the stream and task application logs. This functionality is powered by a new REST API available from Spring Cloud Data Flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dashboard improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch this video for some of the dashboard improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rz-smoRLcFY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patching Database Drivers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community members and the customers who attempted to patch Spring Cloud Data Flow with proprietary database drivers have had the option to clone and build the project locally.&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another option, though. The procedure is now &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/2.2.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#_adding_a_custom_jdbc_driver"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; for both Maven and Gradle users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance Tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We improved our quality of Acceptance tests running against the supported platforms Local, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes (GKE and PKS). This gives us confidence in shipping quality product which we continue to embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Recipes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New recipes are added to help developers configuring and managing the stream applications with Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ and Amazon Kinesis. There is also a recipe on File ingest and ETL processing on Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry. See Spring Cloud Data Flow &lt;a href="https://dataflow.spring.io/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Given all the content is coded as markdown files, it is easy for the community to contribute, so feel free to start the dialog with pull-requests - we are looking forward to your contributions &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-io/dataflow.spring.io"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#stay-in-touch-hellip" class="anchor" name="stay-in-touch-hellip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stay in touch&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <updated>2019-07-24T21:30:30Z</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud continues to prove immensely popular, and over the last few years a number of IaaS providers have provided integration with their technology and joined the release train. This has typically involved getting into the spring-cloud GitHub org and publishing in the org.springframework.cloud Maven groupid. As the number of projects included looks to increase, it is becoming a little unwieldy, and we wanted to take a step back and review the pros and cons that this model provides and propose a better path forward that benefits all projects involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest downside to being part of the release train is that it removes a level of control from the project maintainers. Since the core Spring Cloud team does the releases, maintainers can’t work to the schedule of the technology they are integrating with. Or even if they do manage to get a service refresh out, it won’t be picked up by the release train until the next release train version is released. This model also means that typically the project maintainer doesn’t have direct access to key statistics, such as the Maven download numbers for their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there appears to be a lot of benefits to being part of the release train, but in fact many of these are benefits available to any project, rather than being anything to do with being on the train or in the spring-cloud GitHub org:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Spring Cloud team regularly engages with external projects to help review them and provide constructive feedback on how best to integrate with Spring Cloud. Inclusion in the release train doesn’t make this more or less likely to happen. (Please reach out if you want feedback.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a perception that it makes it easier to get that elusive checkbox on &lt;a href="https://start.spring.io"&gt;start.spring.io&lt;/a&gt;. This is not true. There are &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/wiki/Guidelines-for-3rd-Party-Starters"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; about how to ensure a project is developed such that it is suitable for start.spring.io, but decisions about inclusion are based on more than following a naming scheme. Are we finding that the community is embracing the technology the project is integrating with? Has the project built a vibrant and sustainable community, ensuring a long life and healthy codebase? Are there sufficient docs, guides, etc. showing how to use the project? Nothing in the guidelines necessitates inclusion in a Spring GitHub organization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Spring team regularly produces content involving third-party projects, highlighting key releases or enhancements. There is no need to be part of the release train for this to happen.&lt;br/&gt;The &lt;a href="https://spring.io"&gt;https://spring.io&lt;/a&gt; site obviously includes content that covers the main Spring Cloud projects, but it also includes content that covers some third-party projects. This might be a guide showing how to use the technology or an entry on one of the existing project pages. See &lt;a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud"&gt;https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud&lt;/a&gt;, which refers to many projects &amp;ndash; some of which are on the train and some of which are not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the Spring Cloud team has decided to move to a model that slims down the release train, allowing us to address the downsides whilst keeping all the perceived benefits. The proposal is that IaaS providers will host and maintain their code in their own GitHub organizations. This applies to all of the existing integrations currently on the release train. Spring Cloud Azure have never joined the train, and the Spring Cloud Alibaba team are already embracing this new model as they graduate from the incubator organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#what-will-this-mean-in-practical-terms" class="anchor" name="what-will-this-mean-in-practical-terms"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What will this mean in practical terms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of some of these projects from the Spring Cloud GitHub organization and the release train is not a statement about a change in active development or support policy. The same teams will be working on these, keeping up with Spring Cloud releases. If anything, this change may bring clarity to the support model: if the projects are hosted in the IaaS provider’s GitHub organization, they are obviously providing the support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new model does mean that there will likely be a change in the group-id, and possibly in the artifact-id. It is also likely that the package names will be updated to reflect these changes. Developers will also need to explicitly include these dependencies in their projects, rather than inheriting them via managed versions through the Spring Cloud BOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spring Boot team have &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-developing-auto-configuration.html#boot-features-custom-starter-naming"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for appropriate naming of modules (autoconfiguration and starters). These are not strictly enforced for Spring Cloud, but adherence to the guidelines can mean that anything built relying on the scheme will ‘just work’ (for example, content assist tooling in an IDE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this model, the Alibaba team are graduating from the spring-cloud-incubator into their own GitHub org at &lt;a href="https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba"&gt;https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba&lt;/a&gt;, where we continue to work with them as they head this week for an important release that supports Spring Cloud Greenwich.SR2 and Finchley.SR4. This release will include Sentinel support for Spring Cloud Gateway and enable Nacos service discovery and Spring-Cloud-Config to be used together. Look out for that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can expect to see the other providers move during the release of a future major Spring Cloud train, as a major release is the right time to make a serious change such as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is purely describing the situation and plan for the main Spring Cloud train at this time; it isn’t impacting other projects (for example, Spring Cloud Stream binders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that the reasoning above explains what we are trying to achieve with this strategy. As always, we are receptive to feedback — please let us know what you think. Giving project owners full flexibility to build and release software that better aligns with their culture, whilst continuing to offer all of the benefits of working closely with us on code reviews and project promotion, should benefit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Spring Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to announce the 4.3.1 release of the Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and Theia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights from this release include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(all language servers)&lt;/em&gt; performance: further improvements to the language server startup time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Spring Boot)&lt;/em&gt; fixed: wrong error markers in properties files (&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/issues/314"&gt;#314&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(VS Code)&lt;/em&gt; fixed: vscode goto definition error with lsp (&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/issues/309"&gt;#309&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eclipse)&lt;/em&gt; fixed: STS4 can now be installed again into an existing Eclipse install when running on JDK8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eclipse)&lt;/em&gt; fixed: deadlock when starting up the Spring Boot language server for workspaces with many projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eclipse)&lt;/em&gt; fixed: cannot launch apps in boot dashboard anymore when using early builds of Eclipse 2019-09 (4.13)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eclipse)&lt;/em&gt; improved, but not completely fixed yet: freeze when opening pom.xml file - if you still experience slowness here, please apply the workaround as documented in the issues comment (&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/issues/318#issuecomment-510851757"&gt;comment on #314&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To download the distribution for Eclipse and find links to the marketplace entries for Visual Studio Code and Theia, please go visit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spring Tools 4: &lt;a href="https://spring.io/tools/"&gt;https://spring.io/tools/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed changes can be found here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/wiki/Changelog#2019-07-12-431-release"&gt;https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/wiki/Changelog#2019-07-12-431-release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Tools 4.3.2 is scheduled to be released in late August 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/"&gt;Spring Cloud Data Flow&lt;/a&gt; team is pleased to announce the milestone release 2.2.0.M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some enhancements and bug fixes, here are some of the highlights of the release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics for Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metrics and monitoring continue to be one of the important themes for Spring Cloud Data Flow. Building upon the InfluxDB integration that we have for streams, in 2.2, we are adding support for Tasks, too. The core of the Micrometer integration landed in Spring Cloud Task&amp;rsquo;s 2.2.0 release-line, which by the way is a requirement if you are going to try out the Task-metrics and the SCDF integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For convenience, we have a &lt;a href="https://github.com/tzolov/task-demo-metrics/blob/master/README.md"&gt;sample application&lt;/a&gt; that builds on the compatible upstream versions of Spring Boot, Spring Batch, and Spring Cloud Task. With this application launched in SCDF, you are now able to instrument metrics with InfluxDB as the backend, and likewise visualize the statistics through Grafana dashboard as shown below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzolov/task-demo-metrics/master/docs/grafana-task.png" alt="Screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Logs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of REST endpoints are now available to access the application logs of stream and task applications. Currently, this is available for applications running in Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes platforms. In the upcoming releases, we&amp;rsquo;ll have the Dashboard access to viewing the stream/task application logs along with the Local platform support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patching Database Drivers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The community members and the customers who attempted to patch Spring Cloud Data Flow with proprietary database drivers have had the option to clone and build the project locally. There&amp;rsquo;s another option, though. The procedure is now &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/2.2.0.M1/reference/htmlsingle/#_adding_a_custom_jdbc_driver"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; for both Maven and Gradle users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance Tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To further improve the quality of software that we build and to have more confidence in what we ship, we have invested time to cycle through and overhaul the acceptance-tests. We are now continually running the acceptance-tests on Local, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes (GKE), and PKS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Recipes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, File-ingest and ETL in K8s/CF, and Amazon Kinesis recipes are now available in the latest Spring Cloud Data Flow &lt;a href="https://dataflow.spring.io/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Given all the content is coded as markdown files, it is easy for the community to contribute, so feel free to start the dialog with pull-requests - we are looking forward to your contributions &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-io/dataflow.spring.io"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#stay-in-touch-hellip" class="anchor" name="stay-in-touch-hellip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stay in touch&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we welcome feedback and contributions, so please reach out to us on &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-cloud-dataflow"&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/issues"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or via &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow"&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi, Spring fans! Happy 4th to those of you who celebrate. In today&amp;rsquo;s episode, I talk to the man, the myth, the legend, the good Dr. Venkat Subramaniam on Kotlin, the future of Java, Spring, open-source, being productive and awesome, and so much more. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman/status/1103810728883040256"&gt;a tweet asking that whatever recording I do&lt;/a&gt; with Dr. Subramaniam for the Bootiful Podcast be longer than an hour (wish granted!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The image from today&amp;rsquo;s episode comes from a joint-talk that the good Dr. Subramaniam and I did in Atlanta, GA for the epic Devnexus conference. I am using the photo from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1103692771028803590"&gt;Matt Raible&amp;rsquo;s tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of developers &lt;strong&gt;requested this feature&lt;/strong&gt;, because they&amp;rsquo;d like to compare with another project, or upgrade an existing application. We&amp;rsquo;d like to explore those possibilities more in the future, so &lt;strong&gt;send your feedback our way&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://static.spring.io/blog/damienvitrac/20190703/explore.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore the project:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Depending on the project, the &lt;strong&gt;pom.xml&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;build.gradle&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;build.gradle.kts&lt;/strong&gt; will be shown by default&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this &lt;strong&gt;first version of the feature is not always mobile friendly&lt;/strong&gt; and that we&amp;rsquo;re collecting feedback as a first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate &lt;strong&gt;everyone&amp;rsquo;s help and feedback&lt;/strong&gt; as we continue learning and iterating on the site and the initializr library. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the community, I am pleased to announce that Milestone 1 (M1) of the &lt;a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud"&gt;Spring Cloud Hoxton&lt;/a&gt; Release Train is available today. The release can be found in &lt;a href="https://repo.spring.io/milestone/"&gt;Spring Milestone&lt;/a&gt; repository. You can check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-cloud/wiki/Spring-Cloud-Hoxton-Release-Notes"&gt;Hoxton release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#notable-changes-in-the-hoxton-release-train" class="anchor" name="notable-changes-in-the-hoxton-release-train"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Notable Changes in the Hoxton Release Train&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This milestone release is compatible with Spring Boot 2.2.0.M4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-gateway" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-gateway"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Gateway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud Gateway has added support for &lt;a href="http://rsocket.io"&gt;RSocket&lt;/a&gt;. Look for more in an upcoming blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-contract" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-contract"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Contract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradle support has been updated to 5.5, and Groovy to version 2.5. A major refactoring has happened, simplifying and rewriting to Java where possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-cloudfoundry" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-cloudfoundry"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Cloudfoundry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An option to use Cloud Foundry DNS-based discovery was added. This is useful for container-to container-networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-config" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-config"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Config&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support was added for Google Cloud Source (a Git host) and a new Redis environment repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-sleuth" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-sleuth"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Sleuth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleuth now imports the Brave BOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#roadmap" class="anchor" name="roadmap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker project will move out of Incubator status. Spring Cloud Loadbalancer will be updated to plug holes left by Ribbon being placed in maintenance mode in Spring Cloud Netflix. Spring Cloud Gateway RSocket support will continue to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following modules were updated as part of Hoxton.M1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Module &lt;/th&gt;

    <title>Spring Boot for Apache Geode &amp; Pivotal GemFire 1.1.0.M3 Released!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://spring.io/blog/2019/07/03/spring-boot-for-apache-geode-pivotal-gemfire-1-1-0-m3-released" />

    </author>
    <id>tag:spring.io,2019-07-03:3739</id>
    <updated>2019-07-03T18:46:00Z</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the Spring, Apache Geode and Pivotal communities, I am pleased to announce the release of &lt;em&gt;Spring Boot for Apache Geode &amp;amp; Pivotal GemFire&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;1.1.0.M3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-new"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#whats-new"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main theme of this release was to add support for hybrid cloud deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, perhaps you want to push and run your Spring Boot, Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire applications on &lt;a href="https://pivotal.io/platform"&gt;Pivotal CloudFoundry&lt;/a&gt; (PCF), but connect those applications to an externally managed, standalone Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire cluster.  Now, SBDG allows you to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, SBDG takes advantage of a feature in PCF called &lt;a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/devguide/services/user-provided.html"&gt;CUPS&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Create User-Provided Service&lt;/em&gt;.  By defining your own service descriptor you can connect your Spring Boot applications to externally managed services, like databases, message queues and even In-Memory Data Grids &amp;amp; Caches like &lt;a href="https://geode.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Geode&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pivotal.io/pivotal-gemfire"&gt;Pivotal GemFire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By following a prescribed service descriptor format, it makes it simple to switch to a platform managed service like &lt;a href="https://pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-cache"&gt;Pivotal Cloud Cache&lt;/a&gt; when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we believe this is an important stepping stone for users making their way to a &lt;strong&gt;Cloud-Native&lt;/strong&gt; platform, like PCF, where they still have much invested in their legacy architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do highly recommend using a managed service like &lt;a href="https://pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-cache"&gt;Pivotal Cloud Cache&lt;/a&gt; for your application and Microservices caching needs, but we also realize that making this switch is not as easy as flipping the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to help you get there.  After all, &lt;strong&gt;Cloud-Native (Data) Patterns&lt;/strong&gt; are crucial to the modern application architecture, particularly when talking about things like high availability and resiliency as well as making effective use of your computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about this new support in the &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/1.1.x/reference/html5/#cloudfoundry-geode"&gt;Reference Documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to hybrid cloud support, we also added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auto-configuration for logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support to target specific Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) service instances when multiple instances are bound to your Spring Boot app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrades to Spring Boot &lt;code&gt;2.1.6.RELEASE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade to &lt;em&gt;Spring Test for Apache Geode &amp;amp; Pivotal GemFire&lt;/em&gt; (STDG) &lt;code&gt;0.0.5.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.1.0.M3/spring-geode/src/main/resources/changelog.txt#L7-L21"&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#whats-next"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will push towards our first release candidate, an SBDG &lt;code&gt;1.1.0.RC1&lt;/code&gt;, by mid-July and final GA by end of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a couple of samples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example for &lt;em&gt;Inline Caching&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example on how to get started in under 5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved Documentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating your Feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#conclusion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, feedback is welcomed and appreciated.  Let us know what you think and give the new bits a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of &lt;em&gt;This Week in Spring&lt;/em&gt;! This week I&amp;rsquo;m sunny summer-time San Francisco indulging in a little downtime. Last week was a doozy! I visited Tampa, Flordia; Paris, France; and finally Santiago, Dominican Republic. Later this week, after the 4th of July holiday here in the States, I&amp;rsquo;ll head on over to Medellin, Columbia for JConf Columbia; Chicago, Illinois for the epic SpringOne Tour Chicago event; and then Lima, Peru for the JConf Peru event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rare for a company to want &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; API to be publicly accessible. Most prefer to keep their services secret by default, only exposing APIs publicly when absolutely necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/gateway/"&gt;Spring Cloud Gateway&lt;/a&gt; can help. Spring Cloud Gateway allows you to route traffic to your APIs using simple Java™ instructions (which we saw &lt;a href="https://content.pivotal.io/practitioners/getting-started-with-spring-cloud-gateway-3"&gt;in the last article&lt;/a&gt;) or with YAML configuration files (which we’ll demonstrate in this one). To hide your services, you set up your network so that the only server accessible from the outside is the gateway. The gateway then becomes a gate-keeper, controlling ingress and egress from outside. It’s a very popular pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud-based services also have a habit of changing location and granularity without much warning. To cope better with this, you can combine a gateway with a service registry to allow the applications on your network to find each other dynamically at runtime. If you do this, your applications will be much more resilient to changes. &lt;a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/service-registration-and-discovery/"&gt;Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Server&lt;/a&gt; is one such service registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at Spring Cloud’s gateway and registry components and illustrate how you can use them together to make your applications more secure and more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this arrangement requires a particular setup, we’ve provided ready-to-run code which you can download and run. We’ll be using Docker to orchestrate our services and emulate a private network. We’ll then talk to our running services using HTTPie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#things-you-rsquo-ll-need" class="anchor" name="things-you-rsquo-ll-need"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Things You&amp;rsquo;ll Need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Java (version 8 is assumed), plus your favorite web browser and terminal applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo.git"&gt;The Source Code&lt;/a&gt; – There’s no need to write any code this time, simply &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; (or download and &lt;code&gt;unzip&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo.git"&gt;this project&amp;rsquo;s source code repository&lt;/a&gt; from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop"&gt;Docker Desktop&lt;/a&gt; – Docker will provide our pseudo-production environment. We&amp;rsquo;ll use it to hide our services in a private network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-journey/"&gt;Cloud Native Buildpacks&lt;/a&gt; – We&amp;rsquo;ll use Cloud Native Buildpacks to build Docker container images for us. Buildpacks embody several DevOps best practices, including hardened open-source operating systems and free to use OpenJDK distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;About 10-15 minutes, depending on the speed of your internet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#let-s-get-started-hellip" class="anchor" name="let-s-get-started-hellip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Let’s Get Started&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="#step-1" class="anchor" name="step-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Step 1:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download and install all the &amp;ldquo;things you&amp;rsquo;ll need&amp;rdquo; from the list above. Then change to the runtime-discovery folder in the source code as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint bash"&gt;cd runtime-discovery
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="#step-2" class="anchor" name="step-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Step 2:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build &amp;amp; package the gateway, registry, and service into JARs using Maven, and then create Docker containers for each of them. We have provided a handy &lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo/blob/master/runtime-discovery/pack-images.sh"&gt;pack-images&lt;/a&gt; script to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint bash"&gt; ./pack-images.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="#step-3" class="anchor" name="step-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Step 3:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start up the Docker test environment in the background. We’re using docker-compose here as it can start multiple containers and create a private network for them to communicate on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint bash"&gt;docker-compose up
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="#step-4" class="anchor" name="step-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Step 4:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. Docker will start all the containers (using the configuration provided in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo/blob/master/runtime-discovery/docker-compose.yml"&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/a&gt; file). Waiting a couple of extra minutes here is advised. It gives Docker time to start everything and gives the applications a chance to communicate and settle down. If you do wait, you should see the Gateway and the Greeting Service register themselves with the Registry. There will be lots of logs, but within them will be lines like these from the registry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint bash"&gt;registry    | 2019-06-28 12:19:01.780  INFO 1 --- [nio-8761-exec-2] c.n.e.registry.AbstractInstanceRegistry  : Registered instance REGISTRY/db1d80613789:registry:8761 with status UP (replication=false)&#xD;
registry    | 2019-06-28 12:19:02.380  INFO 1 --- [nio-8761-exec-6] c.n.e.registry.AbstractInstanceRegistry  : Registered instance GATEWAY/9c0c0c9ba027:gateway:8760 with status UP (replication=true)&#xD;
registry    | 2019-06-28 12:19:02.382  INFO 1 --- [nio-8761-exec-6] c.n.e.registry.AbstractInstanceRegistry  : Registered instance SERVICE/fe7e38b21cac:service:8762 with status UP (replication=true)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#let-rsquo-s-try-it-hellip" class="anchor" name="let-rsquo-s-try-it-hellip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Try It&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="#first-check-that-the-greeting-service-is-hidden" class="anchor" name="first-check-that-the-greeting-service-is-hidden"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First, Check that the Greeting Service is Hidden:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greeting Service operates on port &lt;code&gt;8762&lt;/code&gt; and is hidden inside the Docker network. Let&amp;rsquo;s try to call it from your favorite browser using &lt;a href="http://localhost:8762/greeting"&gt;http://localhost:8762/greeting&lt;/a&gt;. You should be told that &amp;ldquo;the site can&amp;rsquo;t be reached&amp;rdquo; by your browser. This is because the Greeting Service is hidden inside the Docker network (as if it were behind a company firewall). It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible for us to talk to the greeting service directly. Instead, you’ll see an error page similar to the one below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.spring.io/blog/bwilcock/20190701/unreachable.png" alt="Screenshot from the browser window showing that the service is unreachable" title="Screenshot from the browser window showing that the service is unreachable" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="#next-access-the-greeting-service-via-the-gateway" class="anchor" name="next-access-the-greeting-service-via-the-gateway"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Next, Access the Greeting Service via the Gateway:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Navigate your browser to &lt;a href="http://localhost:8080/service/greeting"&gt;http://localhost:8080/service/greeting&lt;/a&gt;. You should now get a valid response with content similar to the &amp;ldquo;Hello, World&amp;rdquo; JSON shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint json"&gt;{ &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Hello, World!&amp;quot;}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you issued this new HTTP request from your browser, it was sent to, and handled by, the Gateway. The Gateway service &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; publicly accessible (it’s mapped to port &lt;code&gt;8080&lt;/code&gt;). Your request was forwarded by the Gateway to the Greeting Service on your behalf, and the response was then routed back to you by the Gateway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="#now-view-the-registry-of-services" class="anchor" name="now-view-the-registry-of-services"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now, View the Registry of Services:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microservices on the Docker network are each registering themselves with the Registry server (this may take a couple of minutes, so be patient). The Registry server acts an address book for the services. If the services move, or if new instances are created, they will add themselves to the registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view the current list of registered services, point your browser at &lt;a href="http://localhost:8080/registry"&gt;http://localhost:8080/registry&lt;/a&gt;. You should see a screen similar to the one below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.spring.io/blog/bwilcock/20190701/registry.png" alt="Screenshot from the Registry console, listing several services" title="Screenshot showing the Eureka registry console window in a browser" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="#finally-shutting-down" class="anchor" name="finally-shutting-down"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Finally, Shutting Down:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re done, use &lt;code&gt;ctrl-C&lt;/code&gt; in your terminal to shut down the Docker services. If for any reason this fails to work, you can also use &lt;code&gt;docker-compose down&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;runtime-discovery&lt;/code&gt; folder. Using either technique, you should see output similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint bash"&gt;Stopping gateway  ... done&#xD;
Stopping service  ... done&#xD;
Stopping registry ... done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further clean-up can be achieved using &lt;code&gt;docker-compose rm -f&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#how-it-works" class="anchor" name="how-it-works"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this demo, we have 3 servers. These servers are all running inside a &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo; network which is provided by &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/"&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/a&gt;. Only the &lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo/tree/master/runtime-discovery/gateway"&gt;Gateway server&lt;/a&gt; is exposed to the outside world, so all HTTP traffic must go via this Gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a description of the 3 servers and what each does&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo/tree/master/runtime-discovery/gateway"&gt;The Gateway&lt;/a&gt; – acts as our gatekeeper for all HTTP traffic. All inbound and outbound traffic flows through this portal – it acts as the bridge between the outside world (your browser) and the services on the internal Docker network. The Gateway has a configuration that specifies routes which can be used to talk to the services inside the network. These routes use the &amp;lsquo;logical&amp;rsquo; names of the target services. These logical names are turned into real addresses by the Registry server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo/tree/master/runtime-discovery/registry"&gt;The Registry&lt;/a&gt; – acts as a phone book of all the services on the hidden network. It allows the Gateway to find the Greeting Service using only its logical name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo/tree/master/runtime-discovery/service"&gt;The Greeting Service&lt;/a&gt; – is a simple REST service based on the popular Spring.io guide &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/"&gt;Building a RESTful Web Service&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo/blob/master/runtime-discovery/docker-compose.yml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Docker is configured to only allow external calls to reach the Gateway – on port &lt;code&gt;80&lt;/code&gt;. The other servers (the Registry, and the Greeting Service), cannot be reached directly from outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gateway&amp;rsquo;s configured URL passthrough paths can be seen in the Gateway&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo/blob/master/runtime-discovery/gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml"&gt;application.yml file&lt;/a&gt;. This configuration is using the &amp;ldquo;logical&amp;rdquo; names of these servers and the &lt;code&gt;lb:&lt;/code&gt; (load balancer) protocol as shown in the extract below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint yaml"&gt;spring:&#xD;
  application:&#xD;
    name: gateway  &#xD;
  cloud:&#xD;
    gateway:&#xD;
      routes:&#xD;
      - id: service&#xD;
        uri: lb://service&#xD;
        predicates:&#xD;
        - Path=/service/**&#xD;
        filters:&#xD;
        - StripPrefix=1&#xD;
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using these &amp;lsquo;logical&amp;rsquo; server names, the Gateway can use the Registry to discover the true location of these services at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#wrapping-up" class="anchor" name="wrapping-up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the entire Spring toolkit at your disposal, it quickly becomes apparent how flexible and powerful Spring Cloud Gateway can be. If you dig into &lt;a href="https://github.com/benwilcock/spring-cloud-gateway-demo.git"&gt;the source code&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll notice that with just a few lines of Java and a few dependencies, we can easily integrate Spring Boot microservices with Eureka, and control access to our service’s APIs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you finish, why not sign up for &lt;a href="https://springoneplatform.io/"&gt;SpringOne Platform 2019&lt;/a&gt; – the premier conference for building scalable applications that delight users.
